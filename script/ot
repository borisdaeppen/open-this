=head1 DESCRIPTION

It can be a pain to have to copy Perl module names from a stack trace or some
other output and have to translate that into something which an editor like vim
understands.  This module aims to take some of the pain out of this.  So far I
have tested this only with vim, but I *think* this should also work with emacs
and nano.

The C<ot> script can parse line numbers from text so that you can open your
files at the correct starting point.  It will also try to translate subroutine
names into the appropriate line numbers.  It will look in a lib or t/lib
directory relative to your current path.  If it thinks it has a Perl module
name it will also try to require it and use %INC in order to find the module on
disks.  All security caveats apply when requiring 3rd party modules.
